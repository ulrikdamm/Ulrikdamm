I'm Ulrik Damm, a developer from Copenhagen, currently living in Málaga, Spain.

I've been a programmer for more or less the past 20 years, and in that time been working on a lot of different projects.
Since the launch of the iPhone App Store in 2008, I made mostly apps, working in Objective-C and later Swift, for the company Robotcat. I've in total been working on 17 different apps on the App Store, as far as I could count in my head.

Later, in 2016, I was part of starting the company Northplay, where I've been techical lead on games development ever since. There we've released titles as Conduct THIS/DELUXE/TOGETHER, Fly THIS/TOGETHER and Headland.

We're currently working on our big action-strategy hybrid [Dinolords](https://dinolords.com), featuring vikings on Dinosaurs attacking medieval castles. Please [Wishlist it on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/widget/2587620)!
